  TraFlowPack consists of:
   * TraFlow traffic simulator
   * MMFVPDES, moving mesh finite volume PDE solver

-------------------
Installation Notes:
-------------------
1. Create a directory where you want to install TraFlowPACK.
   for example 'c:\traflowpack\'

2. Unzip all the files in 'traflowpack_vx.x.zip' into this directory.
   'vx.x' stands for the version, e.g. 'v1.0'.
   Make sure the directory-structure as in the zipfile is maintained
   after unzipping.

3. Start MATLAB (TraFlowPACK has been tested on MATLAB 5.3)

4. Change to the traflowpack-directory by entering:
   cd c:\traflowpack\

5. Auto-configure the necessary paths by entering:
   addpaths

6. TraFlowPack is now ready for use. New users should start with:
   help traflowpack

IMPORTANT!
   The path-configuration in step 5. has to be done each time a new
   MATLAB-session is started. Optionally the path can be made lasting by
   adding all the directories mentioned in 'addpaths.m' to the
   standard-MATLAB file 'pathdef.m'.
